eta prime:
- investigate beam energy and bkg cuts (thoroughly)
- determine cuts for 6 costheta bins
- PWA weighted MC
- excessive toy MC studies -> bkg contributions
- calculate sigma minus 2pi0 contribution
- event based fit in RooFit
- BAYES
eta:
- toy MC for event yield asymmetries
    * 1000 events +45 800 events -45, p_gamma= 0.3, 0.25, 10k bins, normalized posteriors: -0.07 +- 0.01 (12 bins in phi) 
    * 5000 events +45 4000 events -45, p_gamma=0.3,0.25, 3k bins, normalized posteriors: -0.07 +- 0.02 (24 bins in phi)
