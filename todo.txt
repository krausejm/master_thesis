eta prime:
- investigate beam energy and bkg cuts (thoroughly)
- determine cuts for 6 costheta bins
- PWA weighted MC
- excessive toy MC studies -> bkg contributions
- calculate sigma minus 2pi0 contribution
- event based fit in RooFit
- BAYES
- test bkg contaminations in event based fit
- update errors(!)
