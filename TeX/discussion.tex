\chapter{Discussion of results}
This chapter will present a discussion of results for the beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ in the reaction $\gamma p \to p\eta'\to p\gamma\gamma$ obtained with the CBELSA/TAPS experiment. No dedicated discussion of the results obtained for $\eta$ photoproduction will be given here. Very good agreement between the results in this work and reference \cite{farahphd}, which discusses the findings for $\Sigma_\eta$ compared to various previous measurements and existing PWA predictions in detail, makes this obsolete. However final remarks regarding the used fitting methods will be made after the results for $\Sigma_{\eta'}$ obtained in this thesis were compared to existing data, and as a next step compared to existing PWA model predictions.
