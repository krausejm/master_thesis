# Determination of the beam asymmetry $\Sigma$ in $\eta$ and $\eta'$ photoproduction using Bayesian statistics
## Master thesis at Helmholtz-Institute (HISKP), University of Bonn
This repository includes analysis scripts as well as the TeX-sources for the thesis and talks. A brief table of contents is given below. Complementary analysis scripts are only available internally for HISKP members.

* `DPG2022` - Subscription and Talk held at the 2022 DPG conference
* `RooFit` - Scripts and plots used to perform an unbinned fit on selected data in $\eta'$ photoproduction, using Root
* `TeX` - All TeX sources for talks and the final thesis. The template used to create the thesis is [ubonnthesis](https://www.pi.uni-bonn.de/lehre/uni-bonn-thesis).
* `bayes` - Summarazies all Bayesian fits that were performed during the thesis using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org)
  -
* `demonstration` - Short snippets of code used for demonstration in the thesis
* `etap_PWA` - PWA predictions for the polarization observable $\Sigma$ in $\eta'$ photoproduction
* `figs` - Plots and graphs generated during the analysis of data acquired at CBELSA/TAPS for $\eta'$ photoproduction
* `prev_results` - Results for the polarization observable $\Sigma$ in $\eta'$ photoproduction from previous measurements at GRAAL and CLAS
* `ressources` - Literature that was used during the course of the thesis
